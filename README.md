This project is about a maze where we have to write the code and find the correct maze for 2 strings which are regular maze and twisty maze. In the regular maze, we just have to follow the directions and write it on the paper then it will automatically gives us the correct string where as the twisty one is time consuming. In that we have to write the address of each directions and it will connect with different directions. Like North connects with North. In the end we will get 2 correct strings that will find 3 magical items which are spellbook, wand, and potion.
